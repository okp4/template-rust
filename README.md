## Purpose & Philosophy

This repository holds the template for building Rust projects with a consistent set of standards across all [OKP4](https://github.com/okp4) projects. We are convinced that the quality of the code depends on clear and consistent coding conventions, with an automated enforcement (CI).

This way, the template promotes:

- the use of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and [semantic releasing](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action) which automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the artifacts (project tarball, docker images, etc.)
- unit testing
- linting via [rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- formatting via [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- a uniform way of building via [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make)

## How to use

> ðŸš¨ do not fork this repository as it is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

1. Click on [Use this template](https://github.com/okp4/template-rust/generate)
2. Give a name to your project
3. Wait until the first run of CI finishes
4. Clone your new project and happy coding!

âš  Do not forget to adapt your project to your needs by editing the `Cargo.toml` file.

## Prerequisites

Be sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) properly installed with [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make).
